# LiveBoats
Simple python program to get the api of boats outside my window from https://www.aishub.net/, using PySimpleGUI to display boat names and types (the AIS returns type as a number, this is then looked up in the json TYPE table). PySimpleGUI also has a really simple loop to update the data in the table.

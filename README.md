# LiveBoats

*one of the first python programs I wrote. I made this so I could learn how to make API calls*

Simple python program to get the api of boats outside my window (or, in this case, the harbour at Douglas on the Isle of Man) from https://www.aishub.net/, using PySimpleGUI to display boat names and types (the AIS returns type as a number, this is then looked up in the json TYPE table). PySimpleGUI also has a really simple loop to update the data in the table.
